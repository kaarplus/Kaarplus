  🔒 ROLE RESTRICTED — implemented for some roles, not others (detail below)

---

## Auth & Sessions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| User registration | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `User` table. API: `POST /auth/register` with bcrypt + JWT. Frontend: `RegisterForm` → `/register` page |
| Login / JWT issue | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `User.passwordHash`. API: `POST /auth/login` issues HTTP-only cookie. Frontend: `LoginForm` → `/login` page |
| Logout | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `POST /auth/logout` clears cookie. Frontend: header has logout action |
| Session check | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /auth/session` (requireAuth). Used by NextAuth provider |
| Forgot password | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `PasswordResetToken`. API: `POST /auth/forgot-password` (strictLimiter). Sends email via `emailService`. Frontend: `ForgotPasswordForm` |
| Reset password | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `PasswordResetToken`. API: `POST /auth/reset-password` validates token, updates hash. Frontend: `ResetPasswordForm` |
| Change password | ⚠️ PARTIAL | API: `POST /auth/change-password` is fully implemented (requireAuth, bcrypt verify + update). **No frontend component exists that calls this endpoint.** Endpoint is unreachable from the UI. |
| OAuth / Social login | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No schema columns, no route, no frontend button. `User.image` column exists but is for profile pictures, not OAuth tokens. |
| Email verification | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No `emailVerified` column in schema, no verification token table, no verification endpoint, no verification gate on login. |

---

## User Profiles

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| View own profile | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /user/profile` → `getUserProfile()`. Frontend: `SettingsPage` fetches and displays name, email, phone, role, createdAt |
| Edit profile (name, phone) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `PATCH /user/profile` → `updateUserProfile({ name, phone })`. Frontend: `SettingsPage` — **profile fields display as read-only with "contact support" message**; `patchProfile` controller exists and works. Profile edit UI is intentionally gated. |
| Notification preferences | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Frontend: `SettingsPage` renders email/messages/favorites/marketing toggles with local state. **No API call is made to persist these settings.** No `notificationPreferences` column or table exists in DB. Settings are lost on page refresh. |
| Dashboard stats | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /user/dashboard/stats` → `getUserDashboardStats()`. Frontend: `DashboardOverview` fetches and passes to `DashboardStats` component |

---

## Car Listings

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| View listing detail | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /listings/:id` → `getListingById()`. Frontend: `/listings/[id]` SSR page → `ListingDetailView` component |
| Create listing (sell wizard) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `Listing` + `ListingImage`. API: `POST /listings` (requireRole USER/DEALERSHIP/ADMIN). Frontend: `SellWizard` — 4-step flow, calls `POST /listings` then `POST /listings/:id/images` |
| Edit listing | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `PATCH /listings/:id` (requireListingOwnership). Frontend: `MyListingsTable` has edit link (routes to `/sell?edit=:id`) |
| Delete listing | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `DELETE /listings/:id` (requireListingOwnership). Frontend: `MyListingsTable` has delete action with confirmation |
| Listing pending approval | ⚠️ PARTIAL | DB: `ListingStatus.PENDING` enum exists. API: listing is created with status PENDING. **Admin approval flow exists** (see Admin section) but the listing is immediately visible? Verify `getAllListings` filters by status. |
| Listing expiry | ⚠️ PARTIAL | DB: `Listing.publishedAt` exists; `ListingStatus.EXPIRED` enum exists. **No `expiresAt` column exists** in schema. No cron job, scheduler, or TTL query found that transitions listings to EXPIRED status automatically. The `EXPIRED` status can only be set manually. |
| Similar listings | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /listings/:id/similar` → `getSimilarListings()`. Frontend: `RelatedCars` component on detail page |
| Contact seller | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `Message` table. API: `POST /listings/:id/contact` (optionalAuth, validates body via `contactSellerSchema`). Frontend: `ContactSellerDialog` — pre-populates from session, validates email for unauthenticated users |

| My listings dashboard | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /user/listings`. Frontend: `MyListingsTable` with status badges, views, favorites, pagination |
| Compare vehicles | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: not needed — comparisons are client-side only. Frontend: `ComparePageClient` + `useCompareStore` (Zustand). `AddVehicleSheet` calls `GET /api/v1/listings?q=...` to search. Comparison table built from locally stored listing data. Up to 4 vehicles, differences-only toggle, share button (share is UI only — no URL serialisation). |

---

| Get makes / models / locations / colors / drive types | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /search/makes`, `/search/models`, `/search/filters`, `/search/locations`, `/search/colors`, `/search/drive-types`. Frontend: home search and filter sidebars call these |
| Platform stats | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /search/stats` → `getPlatformStats()`. Frontend: `HomeSearch` displays total listing count |
| Sponsored listings injection | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `SponsoredListing` table linked to `AdCampaign`. API: `listingController.getAllListings()` prepends sponsored on page 1. Frontend: listings render `isSponsored` badge |

| Update user role / ban user | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No API endpoint exists for modifying a user's role or banning users. The users table `MoreHorizontal` action button in `AdminUsersPage` is a non-functional icon with no handler. |
| Admin inspection management | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | `inspectionController.updateInspectionStatus()` exists with full logic (sets status, sends email). **No admin route mounts this handler.** `adminRouter` has no inspection endpoints. No admin frontend page for inspections. The function is dead code. |

---

## Ad System (Campaigns & Placements)

---

## Payments & Monetisation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Create Stripe payment intent | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | DB: `Payment` table exists with `PaymentStatus` enum. `paymentsRouter` is defined in `payments.ts` but **never imported or mounted** in `routes/index.ts` — the endpoint is entirely unreachable. The `createPaymentIntent` controller returns HTTP 501 with `TODO` comment. |
| Stripe webhook handler | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Route is mounted (`POST /webhooks/stripe`). Webhook signature verification is implemented. `payment_intent.succeeded` case explicitly logs "no action taken" — car purchase flow removed, reserved for future ad payments. No meaningful action occurs. |
| View payment history | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | DB: `Payment` table exists. No API endpoint to read payments. Admin analytics shows payment data inline but there is no dedicated payments listing endpoint. |

---

The seller info card (`SellerInfo`) shows no reviews. The entire reviews API is **never called from the frontend**. |

---

## Dealerships

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| View dealership profile | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /dealerships/:id` → returns dealership + listings. Frontend: `/dealers/[id]` SSR page → `DealershipProfile` component with cover image, logo, bio, contact links, inventory grid |
| Contact dealership button | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Frontend: `DealershipProfile` has a "Contact" button. **The button has no `onClick` handler and no routing** — it is a `<Button>` with no action wired. |

---

## Vehicle Inspections

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Request inspection (buyer) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `VehicleInspection` table. API: `POST /user/inspections` → `inspectionService.requestInspection()`. Frontend: `RequestInspectionDialog` on listing detail page calls the endpoint |
| View my inspections (buyer) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /user/inspections` → `inspectionService.getInspectionsByUser()`. Frontend: `/dashboard/inspections` → `MyInspectionsList` → `InspectionStatusCard` |
| View single inspection | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | API: `GET /user/inspections/:id`. |
| Update inspection status (admin/support) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | `inspectionController.updateInspectionStatus()` is a complete function with email notification logic. **It is never registered on any route.** The admin router has no inspection endpoints. Inspections permanently stay in `PENDING` status with no resolution path. |
| Public inspections page | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | `/inspections` page is a hardcoded "under construction" placeholder with no content or functionality. |
| Download inspection report | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Frontend: `InspectionStatusCard` renders a download button if `reportUrl` is set and status is `COMPLETED`. **`reportUrl` can never be set** because the admin update endpoint doesn't exist. The button is unreachable in practice. |

---

## Newsletter

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subscribe | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | DB: `Newsletter` table. API: `POST /newsletter/subscribe`. Frontend: `NewsletterSignup` shared component (used in footer and other locations) — full form with validation |

## Critical Blockers

Features that are visibly presented to the user but not actually working — the UI makes a promise the backend cannot fulfil:

1. **Inspection approval is impossible** — Users can request an inspection (`RequestInspectionDialog` calls `POST /user/inspections`), the request enters the DB as `PENDING`, and `MyInspectionsList` shows it. But `inspectionController.updateInspectionStatus()` — the function that changes status, schedules inspections, and sends confirmation emails — **is registered on no route**. Every inspection is permanently `PENDING` with no admin resolution path. `InspectionStatusCard` renders a download-report button for `COMPLETED` inspections that can never exist.

2. **Reviews are fully invisible** — The reviews API (`GET /reviews`, `GET /reviews/stats`, `GET /reviews/featured`, `POST /reviews`, `DELETE /reviews/:id`) is complete and functional. **Zero frontend components call any review endpoint.** No review section exists on listing detail pages, no review form is accessible to buyers, no review display appears on dealership profiles. The entire review system is dead from the user's perspective.

3. **Notification preferences are lost on every page refresh** — `SettingsPage` shows four notification toggle switches (email, messages, favorites, marketing). They are wired to local React state only. No API call persists them. No DB column stores them. Every toggle change is silently discarded.

4. **Saved search email alerts never fire** — Users can enable `alertsEnabled` on saved searches and the UI confirms the toggle. No background job, cron, or webhook reads `SavedSearch` records and sends notification emails when matching listings are published.

5. **Change password endpoint is unreachable from the UI** — `POST /auth/change-password` is a fully implemented, authenticated endpoint that correctly verifies the current password and updates the hash. No page, form, or component in the frontend calls it. Users have no way to change their password while logged in (only the forgot-password reset flow works).

6. **Payments are completely non-functional** — The `paymentsRouter` is defined in `routes/payments.ts` but **never imported or mounted** in `routes/index.ts`. Even if it were mounted, `createPaymentIntent` returns HTTP 501 with a TODO comment. The `Payment` DB table exists with a `PaymentStatus` enum and foreign keys, but no payment can be created, recorded, or retrieved through any live endpoint.

7. **Dealership contact button does nothing** — `DealershipProfile` renders a prominent "Contact" `<Button>` in the header. It has no `onClick` handler, no `href`, and no routing. Clicking it has no effect.

---

## Dead Schema

Models or columns in the database that have no corresponding API route or frontend usage reading/writing them directly:

1. **`Payment` model** — Schema has `Payment` table (id, userId, listingId, amount, currency, status, stripePaymentIntentId, stripeSessionId, metadata, createdAt, updatedAt). No mounted API endpoint creates, reads, or updates Payment records. `adminController.getAnalytics()` may read payment data for the analytics dashboard, but no payment record can ever be created since the payment intent endpoint is unreachable.

2. **`GdprConsent.marketing` / `GdprConsent.analytics` columns** — Stored via `POST /user/gdpr/consent`, but never read back by any frontend component. Consent preferences are saved but never influence any behaviour (e.g., no analytics conditional on `analytics: true`).

3. **`Listing.publishedAt`** — Written when a listing is approved. Not used in any frontend display, not used to calculate any derived "time live" metric exposed to users.

4. **`User.bio`, `User.coverImage`, `User.address`, `User.website`, `User.openingHours`** — Used in `DealershipProfile` for DEALERSHIP-role users. For USER-role accounts, these columns are schema-present but never written or displayed.

5. **`VehicleInspection.reportUrl` / `VehicleInspection.inspectorNotes` / `VehicleInspection.scheduledAt` / `VehicleInspection.completedAt`** — All set by `updateInspectionStatus()` which is dead code (no route). These columns are never written in any live code path.

6. **`Review` model** — All five columns (reviewerId, targetId, listingId, rating, title, body) are written by `POST /reviews`. Data is never read by any frontend component.

---

## Dead Routes

API endpoints that exist but are never called by the frontend:

1. **`POST /auth/change-password`** — No frontend component calls this. Grep of `/apps/web/src` for "change-password" returns no results.

2. **`GET /reviews` / `GET /reviews/stats` / `GET /reviews/featured` / `POST /reviews` / `DELETE /reviews/:id`** — No frontend component calls any review endpoint. Grep of `/apps/web/src` for `/reviews` returns no results in fetch calls.

3. **`POST /payments/create-intent`** — Route file exists (`payments.ts`) but the router is never mounted in `routes/index.ts`. Endpoint is HTTP 404 in all environments. Even if mounted, the handler returns 501.

4. **`GET /listings/metadata/featured`** — API endpoint with category switching (newest/electric/hybrid). Not called by any current frontend component (`LatestListings` uses `GET /search` directly; `PremiumListings` uses `GET /search?sort=price_desc`).

5. **`GET /dealerships` and `GET /dealerships/:id`** — Called by the frontend. *(Not dead — listed here for completeness check only. These are used.)*

6. **`GET /mobile/version`** — Returns hardcoded version info. No frontend component calls this endpoint. The `/app` page is static marketing content.

7. **`POST /debug/debug-sentry`** — Development-only Sentry test route. Not called by frontend, intentionally so.
