> **Phase:** 1 — Core MVP
> **Status:** ✅ Complete
> **Dependencies:** P1-T05

## Objective

Implement GDPR-compliant consent management, privacy policy pages, user data export, and account deletion.

## Scope

### Cookie Consent Banner

- Shows on first visit (no cookie set)
- Three categories: Essential (always on), Analytics, Marketing
- Accept All / Reject All / Customize buttons
- Saves consent to `GdprConsent` table and localStorage
- Re-accessible from footer "Cookie Settings" link

### Privacy & Legal Pages

- `/privacy` — Privacy policy (Estonian + English toggle)
- `/terms` — Terms of service
- `/cookies` — Cookie policy
- `/faq` — General FAQ

### User Data Export

- `GET /api/user/gdpr/export` — Returns JSON with all user data:
  - Profile information
  - Listings
  - Favorites
  - Messages
  - Consent records
  - Payment history

### Account Deletion

- `DELETE /api/user/gdpr/delete`
  - Soft-delete user data
  - Anonymize listings (keep for historical data)
  - Remove favorites, messages
  - Clear personal information
  - Send confirmation email
  - 30-day grace period before permanent deletion

### Consent Backend

- `POST /api/user/gdpr/consent` — Save consent preferences
  - Input: `{ marketing: boolean, analytics: boolean }`
  - Logs: timestamp, IP address, consent version
